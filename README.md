<b>Website Demo: </b> https://scisaif.github.io/Joke-Arena/ <br>
This was made to test the axios library : https://github.com/axios/axios <br> 
This is a simple Random Joke generator app. 
It has 3 pages: joke arena, dad jokes, chuck norris jokes. 

I made this app to revise the basics of Javascript, HTML, CSS
Made use of a couple of Joke APIs in this project.
